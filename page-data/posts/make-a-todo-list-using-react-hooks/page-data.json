But we can use them through the alpha version.</p>\n<h2>Setup for React Hooks</h2>\n<p>First, we need to make a react app using <strong>create-react-app</strong>. It will make a create an app for us. For that just run in your terminalnpx create-react-app hooks-todo. It takes some time then it’ll create a react app for you now just to the app by runningcd hooks-todo now we have our <strong>react-app</strong> ready. Run npm install react@next react-dom@next that’ll install the alpha version of React in out app.</p>\n<h2>Let’s Make the Todo</h2>\n<p>In this project, our focus is not to make a layout. So please copy the SASS file for the project from <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/praveen-me/6da4e55421e61adeb91b6d9103814a7f\">here</a>. If you don’t have sass package install just run npm i node-sass.\nNow, let’s move into our App.js and make the App component <strong>functional</strong>. So, now our first move is to make the form for submitting our todo. Just copy this snippet of code into the return statement of our App component. I also called a function on events. We’ll take a look at them later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3112/1*gjDdZHOgAXZ_TPoK-PJ_zg.png\" alt=\"Todo form for adding todo\"><em>Todo form for adding todo</em></p>\n<p>Now, let’s make a state for storing the current todo value. We are using useState <strong>state hook</strong> for making state. We need to import it from <strong>react</strong>.\nFor that add this line at the top of the file <code class=\"language-text\">import React, { useState } from react</code>. Now, go inside our App then add const <code class=\"language-text\">[todoValue, setTodoValue] = useState(&#39;&#39;)</code>. So, here we are making a state <strong>todoValue</strong> and <strong>setTodoValue</strong> is for updating the value of <strong>todoValue</strong> and in the <strong>useState</strong> part, we are just setting the initial value of <strong>todoValue</strong> state by calling useState(). So, if you take a look we are using the array destructing here. <strong>useState</strong> returns an array that the first element of the array is stated name and the second item of the array is the function for updating the value of that state.\nNow, let’s make the <strong>handleChange</strong> function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2840/1*H3FQO1MWyEd7miYraXgJ9Q.png\" alt=\"handleChange for setting current todo value\"><em>handleChange for setting current todo value</em></p>\n<p>So, simple for setting the current todoValue just call the <strong>setTodoValue</strong> function and pass the value as an argument.</p>\n<p>Now, It’s time to work on our adding todo.\nFor that, we need another state. Let’s make const <code class=\"language-text\">[todos, setTodo] = useState([]);</code>. So, we make another state and all our todos are going to store here. I previously made an event-handler to submitting to-do form. Let’s made a function called <strong>handleSubmit</strong> that take care of submitting todo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2840/1*0i8X3wwmpbYUV3c0lmcgzQ.png\" alt=\"function for submitting todo\"><em>function for submitting todo</em></p>\n<p>It’s so simple from line 4 to line 7 we just making a todo object. And then in line 10 we just call <strong>setTodo</strong> function and passing a new array as an argument and the spreading the <strong>todos</strong> array for previous todos and then just adding todo at the end of the array. Now, we did our adding todo functionality we just need to display them.\nWe have to map over the <strong>todo</strong> array and make an element for every todo.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3416/1*V9rjJhWJzR1LqhbkohU-IA.png\" alt=\"block for dispalying todo\"><em>block for dispalying todo</em></p>\n<p>Paste this snippet after the parent div of the App component. As you see we just map over the todos array and creating a block for every todo. I also added the event handler for adding done and delete functionality in our todo.</p>\n<p>Let’s work on delete our todo.\nFor this, we have to make a <strong>handleDelete</strong> function. We take the id from it’s parent element of the delete button and then just going to splice that index form the array then just again called the <strong>setTodo</strong> function and make the new array and spread all todos.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2840/1*MbEox6RvBCE1M1kF5H761w.png\" alt=\"function for deleting todo\"><em>function for deleting todo</em></p>\n<p>Now, we completed our delete todo functionality.\nNow, let’s work on <strong>handleDone</strong> functionality of the todo. For that, let’s just create <strong>handleDone</strong> function. In that, we are going to take the id from its parent element and then change the <strong>done</strong> of that todo and set the <strong>todos</strong> using <strong>setTodo</strong> method.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2840/1*saUQtUiFFCWcBpC7wLrN4w.png\" alt=\"function for handling done of todo\"><em>function for handling done of todo</em></p>\n<p>Congrats, We completed our todo using hooks. I am glad if you make some changes and add more functionality using hooks don’t stop keep experimenting.
